2024_SGHC_311,2,1,"The defendant in OC 660 is Mr Lalit Kumar Modi (“Mr Modi”), whom the claimants aver is an Indian national.  Mr Modi is the appellant in the present appeal. It is common ground between the parties that Mr Modi runs a page on the social media platform “X”, which had 3.8 million followers at the material time (the “Twitter Page”).  Mr Modi also runs a page on the social media platform “Instagram”, which had 5.2 million followers at the material time (the “Instagram Page”)."
2024_SGHC_311,3,1,"The first and second claimants in OC 660 are Mr Daniel Maag (“Mr Maag”) and Mrs Gurpreet Gill Maag (“Mrs Maag”), respectively. Mr and Mrs Maag are hereinafter referred to as the Maags. The Maags are married to each other and are the respondents in this appeal. Mr Maag, a Swiss national, is a private banking and wealth management professional based in Singapore.  He is resident in Singapore and is engaged in his vocation in Singapore. The Maags aver that Mrs Maag is an Indian national and notable venture capitalist.  According to the Maags, Mrs Maag is resident in, and conducts her business principally in, Singapore."
2024_SGHC_311,4,1,"It is accepted by the parties that on 5 May 2023, Mr Modi published a post on the Twitter Page (the “Litigation Post”).  The precise contents of the Litigation Post are immaterial for the purpose of this appeal. The Maags aver, and Mr Modi does not admit, that the Litigation Post was also published by Mr Modi on the Instagram Page on or around 5 May 2023.  The Maags aver that the Litigation Post contained: (a) malicious falsehoods directed against the Maags; and (b) defamatory material directed against the Maags."
2024_SGHC_311,5,1,"It is also accepted by the parties that on or around 5 May 2023, Mr Modi published another post on the Twitter Page (the “Political Hatred Post”).  The Maags aver that the Political Hatred Post contained: (a) malicious falsehoods directed against the Maags; and (b) defamatory material directed against the Maags."
2024_SGHC_311,10,0,"Second, it was argued that the relevant amendments should not be allowed as the Maags failed to obtain the court’s approval to apply to make such amendments.  Specifically, the Maags did not inform the court that they intended to make the relevant amendments to widen their claims in OC 660, when they sought approval to file SUM 3888. The relevant amendments were not stated in the Maags’ Form B9 and letter to the court dated 18 December 2023."
2024_SGHC_311,19,0,"The learned AR applied the three-step analytical framework for the amendment of pleadings as stated by Goh Yihan JC (as he then was) in Wang Piao v Lee Wee Ching [2024] 4 SLR 540 (“Wang Piao”). Nothing turned on the first step of the framework as SUM 3888 was taken out early in the proceedings."
2024_SGHC_311,21,0,"Under the third step of the Wang Piao framework, the court held that the proposed amendments would not cause any prejudice to the other party which could not be compensated in costs. This was because Mr Modi primarily objected to the Maags relying on foreign publication which caused damage outside of Singapore. He did not object to proving the foreign publication going towards claiming damages in Singapore. In either situation, the Maags could prove the foreign publication. If the Maags wished to claim damages outside Singapore, Mr Modi merely needed to state his position that the Maags were not entitled to do so at law. The trial judge could then decide whether to award such damages occurring outside Singapore. If the ultimate decision was that the Maags were not entitled to do so, Mr Modi would be compensated in costs after the trial."
2024_SGHC_311,52,0,"I agree with Mr Modi’s submission. In Review Publishing, Menon JC (as the Chief Justice then was) elaborated on the significance of the jurisdictional gateways under O 11 r 1 of the ROC 2006. The jurisdictional gateways under O 11 r 1 of the ROC 2006 related to specific situations where the claim, cause of action, or relief sought had a sufficient nexus with Singapore. The need to establish a nexus with the home jurisdiction served to prevent the unwarranted extension of the jurisdiction of the court beyond the territorial limits of the country: Review Publishing at [23]." 
2024_SGHC_313,4,1,"Sometime around 26 November 2019, the plaintiff, Mr Khan Aisanullah (the “Plaintiff”), purchased the Company and became its sole shareholder.  The Plaintiff is ordinarily resident in India. As the Plaintiff understood it to be a requirement for every company in Singapore to have at least one director who is locally resident in Singapore, the Plaintiff appointed the defendant, Mr Rajib Kumar Dhali (the “Defendant”), as a director of the Company.  The Defendant is resident in Singapore.  On 26 November 2019, the Plaintiff and the Defendant were appointed as directors of the Company."
2024_SGHC_313,10,1,"On or about 25 January 2021, the Defendant applied to OCBC to remove the Plaintiff’s access to the OCBC Bank Account.  On 26 January 2021, the Plaintiff regained access but lost it again on 27 January 2021.  The Defendant took over the OCBC Bank Account by 27 January 2021.  Between 27 January 2021 and 29 January 2021, the Plaintiff regained access to the OCBC Bank Account, but lost access thereafter."
2024_SGHC_313,11,1,"On 26 January 2021, the Defendant lodged a Transfer of Shares form with ACRA to transfer all of the Plaintiff’s shares in the Company to the Defendant.  The Defendant concedes that he did not furnish any consideration for the Plaintiff’s shares; neither did he obtain the Plaintiff’s consent." 
2024_SGHC_313,29,0,"The other factual issue in dispute is whether the Defendant withdrew moneys from the OCBC Bank Account. The Defendant denies this. As stated above (at [16]), I was not provided with the bank statements of the OCBC Bank Account from February 2021 to the date of closure. Further, while the bank statements for the month of January 2021 was put into evidence, it is unclear from the bank statements who effected the withdrawals."
2024_SGHC_313,76,0,"In conclusion, I dismiss both the Plaintiff’s claim and the Defendant’s counterclaim. I will hear the parties on costs."
2024_SGCA_59,6,1,"As of 27 June 2020, the respondent, then 16 years old, was in a relationship with a female secondary school student. His girlfriend had a close friend and classmate (“the victim”) who was 14 years old. The respondent was an acquaintance of the victim both through his girlfriend and because they had attended the same secondary school for a few years. At that time, the victim was romantically involved with a man (“CPT”), who was then 22 years old and more than seven years her senior."
2024_SGCA_59,7,1,"On that day, the respondent watched an Instagram livestream of the victim, who was drinking alcohol with CPT around Admiralty Park. The respondent asked the victim if he could join the drinking session, and the victim and CPT agreed. The victim had consumed some whisky before the respondent’s arrival, and continued to drink more alcohol after he arrived at CPT’s instigation. After consuming the alcohol, she vomited and laid on the ground."
2024_SGCA_59,17,0,"At the first stage of the Al-Ansari framework, the Judge considered whether rehabilitation was displaced as the dominant sentencing consideration in relation to three factors: (a) the seriousness of the offence; (b) the severity of the harm caused; and (c) whether the respondent was hardened and recalcitrant."
2024_SGCA_59,26,0,"Given the applicable framework in Al-Ansari, the respondent accepted both in the proceedings below and on appeal that if rehabilitation was considered to be the predominant sentencing consideration, the most effective way to reflect this would be by way of RT rather than probation. Thus, this case essentially turned on the proper application of the first stage of the Al-Ansari framework – whether rehabilitation remained the predominant sentencing consideration."
2007_SGCA_37,3,1,"The appellant’s claim stemmed from a dispute relating to the building project known as “The Proposed Redevelopment of Medical Camp in Nee Soon Camp Lot 212 PT MK 13 at Transit Road – Project LE(D) 1068 C08 MINDEF/DSTA” (“the Project”). As its name suggests, the Project was to redevelop a medical facility at Nee Soon Army Camp for the Ministry of Defence (“Mindef”). The Government of Singapore (“the Employer”) put the Project out for tender to which the appellant submitted a “base tender” and an “alternative tender”. In relation to this “alternative tender”, which was submitted on 15 March 1999,[note: 1] the appellant offered an alternative pre-cast/structural design. This alternative design consisted of a change in the original cast-in-situ design to the pre-cast structure design which would result in cost savings of about $200,000 and a shortening of the construction time by two months.[note: 2] The Employer accepted the alternative design and awarded the appellant a contract dated 24 June 1999 (“the Contract”) at a lump sum price of $31.78m to execute and complete the Project. The agreed commencement date of the Contract was 15 June 1999 and the completion date was 14 January 2001."
2007_SGCA_37,21,0,"It is trite law that, in order to succeed in a claim under the tort of negligence, a claimant has to establish that (a) the defendant owes the claimant a duty of care; (b) the defendant has breached that duty of care by acting (or omitting to act) below the standard of care required of it; (c) the defendant’s breach has caused the claimant damage; (d) the claimant’s losses arising from the defendant’s breach are not too remote; and (e) such losses can be adequately proved and quantified: see, for example, Clerk & Lindsell on Torts (Sweet & Maxwell, 19th Ed, 2006) at para 8-04."
2014_SGCA_49,7,1,"On 6 June 2007 at about 12.49pm, the Deceased went swimming with a friend, Er Chee Teck (“Er”), at the Olympic-sized swimming pool at NUS. This was their regular weekly swim, a routine they started in January 2007. The pool had nine lanes, with Lane 1 being the closest to the entrance and Lane 9 being the furthest. After taking about five to ten minutes to change and warm up, the Deceased and Er began swimming in Lane 9. At that time, there were only ten to 15 swimmers in the pool. However, apart from Er and the Deceased, there were no other swimmers in Lane 9."
2014_SGCA_49,13,1,"At 1.25pm, the ambulance arrived. The paramedic tried using a defibrillator on the Deceased to no effect: the Deceased had by then gone into asystole which meant there was no longer any heartbeat. The Deceased was rushed to the National University Hospital and reached there at 1.39pm. The doctor on duty noted that on arrival, the Deceased was unresponsive, without pulse and was not breathing. His vital signs could not be recorded. An electrocardiogram monitor showed he was still in asystole. At 2.27pm, the Deceased was pronounced dead. The autopsy report recorded the cause of death as consistent with drowning with ischaemic heart disease. The Deceased left behind his wife and two young children aged three and six."
2014_SGCA_49,10,1,"Cheong helped Er pull the Deceased out of the water and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (“CPR”) on him. As for Chua, she had found an Oxyviva resuscitation machine (“Oxyviva”) but could not find the automated external defibrillator (“AED”). She brought the Oxyviva to the poolside and went back to search for the AED, which she eventually located and brought to the scene. However, neither Cheong nor Chua could use the AED or the Oxyviva on the Deceased as they were not trained in the use of the equipment."
2014_SGCA_49,14,0,"The Judge held that NUS owed a duty of care to provide properly trained lifeguards. The lifeguards would be expected, inter alia, to survey the pool regularly, to remain alert and be trained to spot swimmers in diff   iculty. He further found that the duty did not extend to the provision of lifeguards trained in the use of Oxyviva and AED. Although this duty was delegable, the Judge found that Hydro was not an independent contractor because NUS had retained a high degree of control over the manner in which Hydro was to carry out its work. Thus, if the Appellant had succeeded in her claim, NUS would have to share a third of the liability with Hydro bearing two-thirds."
2014_SGCA_49,36,0,"The operative negligence as found by the Judge was the failure of the lifeguards to effectively scan the swimming pool with the consequence that they failed to notice that the Deceased had stopped swimming and then sunk to the bottom feet first, and that Er had swum to the Deceased and then struggled with the Deceased to the side of the pool. The lifeguards only realised that something was amiss when they heard Er’s shout for help after Er managed to pull the Deceased to the side of the pool. By this time, the Judge found that about three minutes had passed from the time when the Deceased first got into difficulties to the time Er was able to pull him to the edge of the pool and shout for help."
2014_SGCA_49,65,0,"Finally, the Appellant also raised an issue about the adequacy of the CPR administered by Cheong. The Appellant’s complaint is that Cheong was the only one providing CPR for more than ten minutes and would have become fatigued after a while. First, this is purely speculative and does not address the evidence that the Judge had cited in coming to his conclusion that the CPR provided was of acceptable quality, in particular the chart log produced by the AED. Second, as shown above, CPR alone would not have saved the Deceased whatever the quality administered."
2011_SGCA_39,7,1,"The Appellant was a businessman and national of the Philippines, while the Respondent was an Austrian-incorporated bank which, at the material times, operated branches in Hong Kong and Singapore. In early 1997, the Appellant was recommended the services of one Winnifred Natasha Tong Ching Laude (“Ms Ching”), a vice-president of the Respondent’s Hong Kong branch, and met with her for the purpose of opening an account with the Respondent."
2011_SGCA_39,10,1,"From June to November 1997, the Appellant remitted approximately US$5 million into the Singapore account. From July to October 1997, 16 investments, which comprised mainly emerging market debt instruments, were entered into by Ms Ching under the Appellant’s Singapore account, partly or wholly financed by loans from the Respondent to the Appellant’s Hong Kong account, pursuant to the Loan Facility."
2011_SGCA_39,13,1,"From June to November 1999, there was an exchange of correspondence between the parties, in which the Appellant expressed unhappiness over the state of his investments (including complaints that certain investments were unauthorised), eventually culminating in the Appellant threatening legal action against the Respondent over its alleged “mishandling” of his investment accounts. The Appellant subsequently made good on his threat and commenced the present proceedings."
2011_SGCA_29,17,0,"As a preliminary point, we should note that, although the Appellant did not dispute the applicable principles in this case, we were of the view that there was some misconception as to what those principles actually entailed, and that such misconception needed to be clarified."
2011_SGCA_29,26,0,"s to whether the Respondent owed the Appellant a duty of care in the tort of negligence, we also disagreed with the Judge’s conclusion that no duty of care had arisen. It was here that the parties’ failure to articulate clearly the nature of a duty of care in the tort of negligence was most keenly felt, for the Judge’s refusal to impose a tortious duty on the Respondent would likely have been influenced by the undesirability of requiring private banks to continuously give advice to their clients on each and every one of the client’s investments throughout the lifespan (no matter how long) of those investments, in the manner contended for by the Appellant (see [22] above)."
2011_SGCA_29,44,0,"In our view, it was always open to banks and other providers of financial services to exclude or limit their duty of care via disclaimers or exclusion clauses, subject of course to the controls of the UCTA and/or the common law. The absence of such measures, coupled with the factual circumstances of this case, led us to the conclusion that a duty of care was owed."
2024_SGHC_286,4,1,"On 1 September 2021, Farm to Fork purported to terminate the Consultancy Agreement with immediate effect, although cl 3.2 of the Consultancy Agreement provided for termination by prior written notice of not less than three months. In its termination notice, Farm to Fork referred to cl 3.2 and said that as it intended to terminate the agreement with immediate effect, it would pay Adamas $66,660 “representing 3 months’ of consultancy fees as payment in lieu of notice”.  The termination notice was however not accompanied by payment of the stated sum, and Farm to Fork never made that payment."
2024_SGHC_286,2,1,"The plaintiff, Farm to Fork Sdn Bhd, (“Farm to Fork”) is a Malaysian company founded in 2015 by Jonathan Weins (“Mr Weins”), Christian Edelmann (“Mr Edelmann”), and Jessica Li (“Ms Li”) (collectively, the “Founders”)."
2024_SGHC_286,30,0,"Although the appellant’s claim was dismissed at first instance, this decision was overturned by the Court of Appeal, which held that there was a wrongful dismissal that entitled the appellant to damages. Dissatisfied, the appellant appealed to the Privy Council, seeking a declaration that his dismissal was null and void, and so he was still employed by the respondents."
2024_SGHC_286,56,0,"The normal measure of damages for wrongful termination is – subject to the principles of mitigation – the amount that the employee would have received under the employment contract if the employer had lawfully terminated the contract, either by giving the required notice or by paying salary in lieu of notice (see, eg, Wee Kim San at [25])."
2024_SGHC_268,2,1,"Oan was acquainted with Leong through Oan’s son-in-law, Mr Jerrold Phang (“Jerrold”). Jerrold’s evidence is that in 2019, Leong shared some investment opportunities with him. Jerrold then arranged a meeting between Oan and Leong, for Leong to share this opportunity with Oan."
2024_SGHC_268,3,1,"Around 8 November 2019, Oan met Leong together with Jerrold (“8 November Meeting”). Oan claims that at this meeting, Leong made certain verbal representations about the investment and Leong orally agreed to manage $5m of Oan’s funds on the basis of certain terms of agreement (“Investment Agreement”)."
